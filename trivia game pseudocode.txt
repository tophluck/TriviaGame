trivia game pseudocode steps:

create html page with the following:
- background for page and/or question area
- create title
- create content div that has initial start button

set up global variables for game
- questions object where each question is an object that has question1: {question text: text}, {option 1: text, etc.} and {correct answer: right answer letter}
- correct questions
- incorrect questions
- unanswered questions

start button should use jquery to update content div with the following items:
- above question should be a timer, similar to stopwatch activity, that counts down from 30 instead of up. only seconds are needed for display. 
- should update with questions from questions object.
--- first section of question area should grab q1 text from the question text item in the question1 object
--- next should run through question1 object and create div for each option, with the text being the from that option's text. this should use a for loop going through each question.

if timer reaches zero:
- call upon "noAnswer" function that updates content with message saying they didn't answer, tells them the correct answer by going in the question they're on and using the {correctAnswer} item, and adds one to unanswered questions variable. 
- After a set amount of time on this screen, it should move onto the next question by going through the same process as if the start button was hit.

if answer is selected:
- check to see if text inside selected div matches that of the {correctAnswer}
--- if so, update page with correct message and adds one to correct questions
--- if not, update page with incorrect message, tell them the correct answer by the same way as if no answer, and add one to incorrect questions.
- for either outcome, the page should move on to the next after a set amount of time

after all questions have been answered it should go to the end game screen:
- this page should show the correct answers, incorrect answers, and unanswered amounts.
- below this, a button should exist to start over the game. This button should do the following:
--- set incorrect, correct, and unanswered questions to 0
--- go back and content div the same as if the start button had just been pressed, with question 1 being shown.
